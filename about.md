#Cyrus Mohammadian

I recently graduated with a doctorate in the Department of Political Science with an emphasis on spatial econometrics from the University of Southern California. I also receievd an MA in International Relations from the same institution and a BA in Political Science and Central Eurasian Studies from Indiana University, Bloomington. My research focuses on computational approaches to the study of migration, ethnic competition, and violence. I also enjoy playing soccer, hiking, camping, and cooking on my free time.
